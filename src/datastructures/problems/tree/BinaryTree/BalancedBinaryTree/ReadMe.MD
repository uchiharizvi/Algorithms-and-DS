# **Balanced Binary Tree**

A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) 
where n is the number of nodes. 

For Example:

The AVL tree maintains O(Log n) height by making 
sure that the difference between the heights of the left and 
right subtrees is atmost 1. 

Red-Black trees maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that 
the number of Black nodes on every root to leaf paths is the 
same and there are no adjacent red nodes. 

Balanced Binary Search trees are performance-wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.
